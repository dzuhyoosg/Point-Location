DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT:
This project is mainly about to solve the point location problem among line arrangements in the plane.EXTRA CREDITS:
I wrote a graphical interface for this project that can display the lines and points. Users could enter the filename into the textfield at the bottom of the canvas and after pressing enter, lines and points will be displayed in the canvas. Click the “Clear Points” will clear all of the points in the canvas. User can also select the points to compare. 

There will also be tip messages show up if the user put their mouse on the button and textfield without click anything.

You might notice that the lines display in the canvas is upside down… this is just something deals with the y-coordinate. But this does not affect the whole project.
